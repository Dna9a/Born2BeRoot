# Description
This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. 
Thats by creating your first virtual machine in `VirtualBox` (my case) using specific instructions.  Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

## Virtualization

Virtualization is a technology used to create virtual representations of `servers`, `storage`, `networks`, and `other physical machines`. Virtualization software `mimics` the functions of physical hardware, allowing multiple virtual machines to run simultaneously on a single physical machine. Businesses use virtualization to utilize hardware resources more efficiently and achieve better returns on their investment. It also powers cloud computing services, helping organizations `manage infrastructure` more effectively. Additionally, virtualization is a solution for limited hardware resources, as it provides users with an isolated environment. The physical machine is called the host, while the virtual machine running on it is called the guest.

<!-- section must also explain the choice of operating system
(Debian or Rocky), with their respective pros and cons. It must indicate the main
design choices made during the setup (partitioning, security policies, user manage-
ment, services installed) as well as a comparison between:
◦Debian vs Rocky Linux
◦AppArmor vs SELinux
◦UFW vs firewalld
◦VirtualBox vs UTM -->
