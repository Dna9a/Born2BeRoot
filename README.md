# Description
This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. 
Thats by creating your first virtual machine in `VirtualBox` (my case) using specific instructions.  Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

## Virtualization


Virtualization is technology that you can use to create virtual representations of `servers`, `storage`, `networks`, and other `physical machines`. Virtual software mimics the functions of physical hardware to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single physical machine. Businesses use virtualization to use their hardware resources efficiently and get greater returns from their investment. It also powers cloud computing services that help organizations manage infrastructure more efficiently. That's Another solution for hardware lacking this one comes aimming to give the users a isolated space from a host machine this one is called a guest one

# The algorithm


#  A Project description 
<!-- section must also explain the choice of operating system
(Debian or Rocky), with their respective pros and cons. It must indicate the main
design choices made during the setup (partitioning, security policies, user manage-
ment, services installed) as well as a comparison between:
◦Debian vs Rocky Linux
◦AppArmor vs SELinux
◦UFW vs firewalld
◦VirtualBox vs UTM -->
